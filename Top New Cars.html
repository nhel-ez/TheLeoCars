<div class="title"><h1>10 Top New Cars of the Year</h1>
<p>SUVs and performance models lead <br>the charge of the best new cars for 2018</p>
</div></div>

<div class="intro">
<hr><br><p>The best new cars of 2018 are outstanding all-around performers—shown to be reliable, safe, and satisfying. That means they have scored high in our stringent track tests and extensive owner surveys.</p><br><hr>

<div class="topcontent">
<table><th><img src="images/TopCar1.JPG" alt="Compact Car: Toyota Corolla" style="border:2px solid midnightblue;">
<h1>Compact Car: Toyota Corolla</h1><hr>
<p>This practical, fuel-efficient sedan has all the virtues that small-car shoppers seek, backed by its strong reliability track record. Despite its compact proportions, the Corolla has a relatively roomy interior, with a spacious backseat. Handling is secure, and the ride quality is a cut above for its class. The ho-hum engine with middling power won’t excite drivers, but the trade-off is stellar fuel economy of 32 mpg overall. On our highway test circuit, the Corolla achieved 43 mpg. Also very meaningful: This car comes standard with advanced safety features that include forward-collision warning, pedestrian detection, automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and lane-keeping assist. The Corolla is a smart purchase that won’t let you down.

<th><img src="images/TopCar2.JPG" alt="Compact Green Car: Chevrolet Bolt" style="border:2px solid orange;">
<h1>Compact Green Car: Chevrolet Bolt</h1><hr>
<p>The Bolt proves that electric cars need not apologize for a lack of driving performance. This distinctive-looking hatchback delivers brisk acceleration and tight handling, plus a 250-mile electric range at a mainstream price (when tax incentives are factored in). This pure electric is built around a 60-kWh battery pack that holds a generous charge, reducing anxiety that you’ll run out of power and be stranded. The driver sits high up in the Bolt, with a commanding view on a par with a small SUV. Like most electric cars, the Bolt is strikingly silent, and road and wind noise are minimal. Controls take a little getting used to, and at times the ride can become choppy. All told, GM has performed an impressive feat with the Bolt.

<th><img src="images/TopCar3.JPG" alt="Luxury Compact Car: Audi A4" style="border:2px solid darkblue;"><h1>Luxury Compact Car: Audi A4</h1><hr>
<p>The A4 shines by being sporty, luxurious, and polished in a segment populated by superstars. It’s very satisfying to drive, with nimble, secure handling helped by its minimal body roll and responsive steering. The controlled ride is on the firm side, but proves steady and absorbent. The powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine accelerates with gusto, proving ever-eager to make a quick getaway, yet doesn’t hurt your wallet at the pump. Slide into the A4’s cabin and you’re greeted by a high-quality interior. The controls have a precise feel and a clean, modern look. The front seats are firm yet comfy, but the rear seat space is tight. The A4 is an exquisite sedan for discriminating buyers. It comes with standard forward-collision warning and city-speed automatic emergency braking.

<th><img src="images/TopCar4.JPG" alt="Midsized Car: Toyota Camry" style="border:2px solid white;"><h1>Midsized Car: Toyota Camry</h1><hr>
<p>The Camry has earned its reputation as a competent, well-rounded family sedan. With its recent redesign, Toyota added more styling flair and handling acumen. And Toyota elevated its fuel economy to 32 mpg overall with the base four-cylinder, matching its smaller Corolla cousin. The hybrid LE version returned an impressive 47 mpg overall in CR tests, almost reaching rarefied Toyota Prius territory. This Camry offers spry handling, an absorbent ride, and a quiet cabin. (The SE and XSE allow buyers to add sportiness at the expense of quiet and comfort.) Forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and lane-departure warning are standard, and blind-spot detection and rear cross-traffic warning are available.
Price as tested: $26,364-$28,949</p></th>

<th><img src="images/TopCar5.JPG" alt="Large Car: Chevrolet Impala" style="border:2px solid black;"><h1>Large Car: Chevrolet Impala</h1><hr>
<p>The Impala continues to be a gem among large cars, providing a driving experience that’s more akin to a luxury car. The spacious, quiet cabin is well-dressed with high-quality materials and trim. The controls are refreshingly intuitive and easy to use, including the feature-rich infotainment system. The roomy, supportive front seats coddle occupants, and the rear seats are generously proportioned. Its smooth ride is a true standout, soaking up bumps like a sponge. Handling is commendable, as proven in our accident-avoidance maneuver and when confronting corners at our track. We favor the V6 engine for its abundant, smooth power. Those in the market would be wise to consider an Impala.

<th><img src="images/TopCar6.JPG" alt="Minivan: Toyota Sienna" style="border:2px solid darkred;"><h1>Minivan: Toyota Sienna</h1><hr>
<p>Minivans are the ultimate solution for moving people and their stuff. In this segment, the Sienna offers the best all-around package. Its long list of pluses includes a comfortable ride and an energetic powertrain that returns respectable fuel economy. And those looking for an all-wheel-drive minivan quickly realize the Sienna is the only option out there. The cabin is spacious, with convenient folding seats and available seating for eight. The interior is nicely furnished, with top versions dressed with upscale materials and trim accents. The fancy top-line Limited versions offer second-row lounge seating, complete with footrests. Its strong reliability track record and abundant standard advanced safety features make the Sienna a savvy choice.

<th><img src="images/TopCar7.JPG" alt="Compact SUV: Subaru Forester" style="border:2px solid silver;"><h1>Compact SUV: Subaru Forester</h1><hr>
<p>This is a practical, smartly packaged small SUV that prizes fuel economy, room, visibility, and reliability over trendiness or flash. It’s easy to get in and out of, there’s plenty of passenger room, and it drives well. The standard 2.5-liter engine provides only decent performance but it offers exceptional fuel efficiency. And the available turbocharged four-cylinder transforms the Forester into a much more sporting machine. Its all-wheel drive comes standard, and it provides tenacious all-weather grip. The ride is comfortable and handling is responsive. Key safety features, such as forward-collision warning and automatic emergency braking, are available on most trims by getting Subaru’s EyeSight package. The Forester is a wise choice that makes a pleasant travel companion, whether you're road-tripping or commuting.
Price as tested: $27,145</p></th>

<th><img src="images/TopCar8.JPG" alt="Luxury Compact SUV: BMW X3" style="border:2px solid white;"><h1>Luxury Compact SUV: BMW X3</h1><hr>
<p>Redesigned for 2018, the X3 tops its class. This luxury compact SUV combines driving enjoyment, comfort, slick technology, and utility in one appealing package. Its power is smooth and nearly immediate when you press the gas pedal, even with the base turbo four-cylinder engine. (Drivers can step up to the 355-hp M40i for truly exhilarating performance.) Sharp, sporty handling encourages drivers to seek curvy roads. The firm suspension makes you feel safe and confident, and yet the X3 does a good job soaking up ruts and bumps. Because it’s extremely quiet, richly appointed, and offers supportive seats and an easy-to-use infotainment system, the X3 is certain to delight those looking for an upscale SUV that is polished and fun to drive.

<th><img src="images/TopCar9.JPG" alt="Midsized SUV: Toyota Highlander" style="border:2px solid lightgreen;"><h1>Midsized SUV: Toyota Highlander</h1><hr>
<p>Three-row SUVs have become the vehicle of choice for many families. They provide all-weather traction and roomy interiors without looking like a minivan. The Highlander stands out in this crowd with its good performance, fuel economy, and reliability. It benefits from Goldilocks sizing: large enough to accommodate eight passengers but small enough for relatively easy parking. The Highlander rides well, and its handling is secure. Recent updates have improved fuel economy and power, adding to the Highlander’s appeal. And advanced safety features are now standard across the lineup. Overall, the Highlander is a rational choice that will appeal to the majority of buyers looking for a well-rounded, highly functional three-row SUV.
Price as tested: $41,169-$50,875</p></th>

<th><img src="images/TopCar10.JPG" alt="Full-Sized Pickup Truck: Ford F-150" style="border:2px solid black;"><h1>Full-Sized Pickup Truck: Ford F-150</h1><hr>
<p>The best-selling vehicle in America is an impressive, innovative workhorse. The F-150 pulls ahead of the pack thanks to its weight-reduction design and turbocharged six-cylinder engine. This strategy delivers a standout 19 mpg overall, quick acceleration, and effortless towing ability from the potent 2.7-liter turbo V6 engine. Clever features abound, from the Sync 3 infotainment system to Pro-Trailer Backup Assist, which simplifies the otherwise tricky task of backing up while towing a trailer. The crew cab features a spacious rear seat and ample room for tools and gear. Ultimately, the F-150 won’t offer as smooth a ride as a car or an SUV, but it’s an excellent truck.

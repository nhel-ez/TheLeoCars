<div class="title"><h1>The 10 best Ford cars of all time</h1>
<p>Here’s a list of our top 10 Ford of All Time</p>
</div></div>

<div class="intro">
<hr><br><p>Ford is about more than the F-Series pickup.
Historically, the Blue Oval has built some of the greatest cars ever seen on U.S. roads. And while that truck has been a consistent drumbeat to the history of the company (not to mention a primary profit generator), it’s not a stretch to claim that the automaker forged its legacy through the cars it made and marketed. The Model T. The “Deuce Coupe.” The GT40, with its GT progeny. And, of course, the Mustang.</p><br><hr>
</div>

<div class="topcontent">
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford1.JPG" alt="1908 to 1927 Model T" style="border:2px solid black;">
<h1>1908 to 1927 Model T</h1><hr>
<p>Hey! The original Tin Lizzie kind of started this whole crazy automotive thing.
While cars had been around for years prior to the debut of the Model T, it was this particular car that made the dream of mobility possible for the middle class. Thanks to Henry Ford and the magic of assembly line production, the price of a car went from around $800 to $250…well within range for millions of hard-working Americans.</p></th>
</table>
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford2.JPG" alt="1932 Ford V8" style="border:2px solid firebrick;">
<h1>1932 Ford V8</h1><hr>
<p>What makes a car truly beloved is the way it captures the imagination of the public. Do people love it? Name it? Do we make it an extension of our personalities, show it off and shine it up for all world to see?
We do if we own a 1932 Ford V8.
That’s what the V8 engine did at a critical time for Ford, with competition growing in the personal transportation space. With power, style and romance, the 1932 Ford Model 18, also known as the Ford V8, continued the automaker’s evolution away from basic transportation.</p></th>
</table>
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford3.JPG" alt="1955 to 1957 Ford Thunderbird" style="border:2px solid lightgreen;"><h1>1955 to 1957 Ford Thunderbird</h1><hr>
<p>Was a more beautiful, dreamy car ever produced? Maybe not. From American Graffiti to the Beach Boys, the original Thunderbird was a summer daydream on wheels, a reminder of better days – and the hope that everyday life could be both sexy and glamorous.
Introduced as a competitive answer to the Chevrolet Corvette, the Thunderbird was nonetheless different (it had roll up windows!), and as such, Ford avoided the “sports car” moniker, preferring to label the Thunderbird as a “personal car.” Maybe it’s just me, but it always seemed more like a personal statement than a raucous mover and shaker.</p></th>
</table>
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford4.JPG" alt="1964.5 to 1969 Ford Mustang" style="border:2px solid black;"><h1>1964.5 to 1969 Ford Mustang</h1><hr>
<p>If Ford had never built a Mustang, there would be no Camaro. No ‘Cuda. No Pony Car Wars. Hell, without the Mustang, Burt Reynolds would never have driven that sexy black Screaming Chicken in “Smokey and the Bandit.”
Competition. You gotta love it.
Fact is, as far as pony cars go, the most notable, famous and first one has got to be the Mustang. What was once called a “mule” and “secretary’s car” ended up sparking a war that defined imaginations across generations and spurred a tidal wave of car enthusiasts.</p></th>
</table>
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford5.JPG" alt="1965 to 1968 Ford Country Squire" style="border:2px solid brown;"><h1>1965 to 1968 Ford Country Squire</h1><hr>
<p>Back before SUVs roamed school parking lots and shopping malls, there was the wagon. The beautifully simple and accommodating station wagon and its three rows: front, back, and “way back.”
Indeed, for many years, wagons were everywhere. They did just about everything a family needed a car to do, from people hauling (8 to 10 adults and children, easy) to luggage (on the roof rack).</p></th>
</table>
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford6.JPG" alt="1981 to 1990 Ford Escort" style="border:2px solid snow;"><h1>1981 to 1990 Ford Escort</h1><hr>
<p>I once drove a 1982 Ford Escort 2-door hatchback from New Jersey to California. And because my friend and I did it in 52 hours, I can positively attest to the practical, comfortable, and fuel-efficient nature of this car. It was a winner at what it was designed to do. In fact, Ford called the Escort its “world car,” and it became a consistent best-seller for the company thanks to exactly these traits.</p></th>
</table>
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford7.JPG" alt="1985-1989 Merkur XR4Ti" style="border:2px solid red;"><h1>1985-1989 Merkur XR4Ti</h1><hr>
<p>Consider it a case of Euro envy, perhaps, or a great idea that we Americans just weren’t ready for. Either way, the Merkur XR4Ti was arguably a great car in search of an American identity, yet sadly ahead of its time.
Or maybe it had poor damn timing.
Based on Ford’s European Sierra 3-door hatch model, the Merkur was essentially an Americanized euro hot hatch with a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. It was brought to the States by Automotive legend Bob Lutz. According to AutoWeek, Lutz felt the Sierra, with changes, could compete against compact luxury sedans.</p></th>
</table>
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford8.JPG" alt="1986 to 1995 Ford Taurus" style="border:2px solid silver;"><h1>1986 to 1995 Ford Taurus</h1><hr>
<p>I never really liked the Taurus much. Yeah, I know it was once “America’s Best-Selling Car.” And it waged a mighty battle with the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord for the hearts and minds of car buyers across its first two generations, from 1986 to 1995. But in retrospect, well, it’s boring.
Despite my lack of interest, I can certainly appreciate what the Taurus did for Ford. When it debuted for 1986, it was a landmark vehicle, futuristic and aerodynamic and unlike any other car to come before it. This bold long shot proved absolutely YUGE for Ford, and it arguably saved the company.</p></th>
</table>
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford9.JPG" alt="2005 to 2006 Ford GT" style="border:2px solid red;"><h1>2005 to 2006 Ford GT</h1><hr>
<p>If you’re Ford and it’s time to celebrate 100 years of auto making…what do you do? You don’t just slap a “100” on the back of an Explorer. Or come out with a new shade of blue for the F-Series. No. You build an inspirational version of your most significant race car, the one that one-upped Enzo Ferrari at Le Mans.
That would be the 2005 GT, designed to be a retro-awesome version of the famed GT40.
Brought out to celebrate Ford’s 100-year birthday, it was built for the 2005 and 2006 model years. Recently, Ford resurrected it as the brand’s supercar, powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine that makes a slightly unbelievable 647 horsepower. You might be able to order one for around $450,000.</p></th>
</table>
<table>
<th><img src="images/Ford10.JPG" alt="2016 - 2018 Ford Focus RS" style="border:2px solid skyblue;"><h1>2016 - 2018 Ford Focus RS</h1><hr>
<p>As recently as 2017, it was honored as our Best Performance Car because it’s a damn fine hot hatch powered by Ford’s 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder engine. That makes 350 horsepower and 350 lb.-ft. of torque – a lot of power for a 3,434-pound car.</p></th>

<div class="intro">
<hr><br><p>Sports car owners pick their set of wheels for a variety of reasons. For example, you might think the throaty thrum of a muscular engine is music to your ears. Or maybe you prize the nimble handling and quickness that set many sports cars apart from sedans and luxury cars .</p><br><hr>

<h1>BMW M3</h1><hr>
<p>When you're in the market not just for a sporty sedan, but one that's jam-packed with luxurious features as well, the 2017 BMW M3 might fit the bill. This four-door, four/five-passenger sports car is significantly roomier than some of the traditional sports coupes on this list while still retaining a compact, sleek, and aerodynamic design.
And for the 2017 model year, the M3 sees a number of upgrades from previous years. The 2017 M3 comes in only one trim level, but it is available as either a four- and five-passenger high-performance sedan, depending on the specific style you select. Standard features across both options include: keyless entry/ignition, heated 10-way front seats, carbon-fiber trim accents, and a navigation system.</p></th>

<th><img src="images/SportsCar2.JPG" alt="Subaru BRZ" style="border:2px solid yellow;">
<h1>Subaru BRZ</h1><hr>
<p>Last year, the Subaru BRZ got its biggest update since its introduction in 2013. The 2017 Subaru BRZ is still a two-door coupe, and it still seats four (the backseaters will be comfiest if they’re kid-sized). The suspension got some tweaks to help it hug the corners better, and there’s an available performance package that comes with bigger Brembo® brakes for added stopping power, which let you hit the twisties with more confidence.
The 2017 Subaru BRZ gives you three trim levels to choose from: Premium, Limited, and Series. With all trim levels, this rear-wheel-drive sports car comes standard with a 2.0L four-cylinder engine and a six-speed manual transmission. This combination gives you plenty of power and responsive handling.</p></th>

<th><img src="images/SportsCar3.JPG" alt="Mazda MX-5 Miata" style="border:2px solid red;"><h1>Mazda MX-5 Miata</h1><hr>
<p>New for 2017 is a "Retractable Fastback" option for the Mazda MX-5 Miata. In addition to this sports car's low-slung body and sleekly powerful lines, you'll like the fact that you can retract the roof at an intersection before the stoplight changes from red to green. Rather than stowing completely away, only the rear window and overhead roof panel disappear. It’s a classy look for a two-seater. If you have your heart set on a soft top, you can also choose one (as a manually-folding option).
Available in three trim levels, the 2017 Mazda MX-5 Miata is powered by a standard 2.0L four-cylinder engine that delivers 155 hp. While the Sport trim level comes with black cloth-trimmed sport seats, the Club version adds red accent stitching. If you want to sink into supple leather seats, opt for the Grand Touring trim level.</p></th>

<th><img src="images/SportsCar4.JPG" alt="Subaru WRX" style="border:2px solid royalblue;"><h1>Subaru WRX</h1><hr>
<p>The Subaru WRX takes the vision of what usually comprises the best sports cars — two doors, rear-wheel drive, and two passengers – and turns it on its head. A five-passenger sedan, the 2017 Subaru WRX Premium is powered by a four-cylinder, turbocharged engine. In our Subaru WRX review, we loved this four-door’s six-speed stickshift and nimble handling.
For 2017, the WRX retains its precise steering and nimble handling. Its all-wheel drive gives you additional traction that helps to minimize any power loss should you spin the wheels coming out of a turn on slick terrain.</p></th>

<th><img src="images/SportsCar5.JPG" alt="Nissan 370Z" style="border:2px solid darkblue;"><h1>Nissan 370Z</h1><hr>
<p>If classic sports car styling is what gets your heart racing, the 2017 Nissan 370Z delivers. The coupe and convertible models come standard with a V6 engine that's situated farther back on the car's frame. This more-balanced weight distribution gives it a maneuverability that you'll love.
If you’re a sports car purist, opt for the 370z’s available six-speed manual transmission. You can also sit back and let the seven-speed automatic do the shifting for you. For a bump in horsepower to 350 ponies – as well as some serious racecar looks — opt for the Nismo coupe-only model.</p></th>

<th><img src="images/SportsCar6.JPG" alt="Volkswagen GTI" style="border:2px solid darkgreen;"><h1>Volkswagen GTI</h1><hr>
<p>Since its introduction to the US market in 1983, the Volkswagen Golf GTI has gained an almost iconic status. It folds sporty styling, a powerful engine, and a generous cargo area into a compact body. A four-door hatchback (two-door GTIs were phased out at the end of the 2016 model year), the 2017 GTI is offered in four trim levels.
As a front-wheel-drive sports car, the 2017 Volkswagen GTI S comes with a 2.0L, turbocharged four-cylinder engine as standard equipment. If you want more horsepower under the hood of this compact powerhouse, choose a Sport, SE, or Autobahn trim level, which bumps your hp to 220.</p></th>

<th><img src="images/SportsCar7.JPG" alt="Chevrolet Corvette" style="border:2px solid darkred;"><h1>Chevrolet Corvette</h1><hr>
<p>All-American sports car fans can’t go wrong with the Chevrolet Corvette. This two-seater, sporty car is available either as a low-slung and graceful coupe or as a convertible. New for 2017 is a Grand Sport trim level that joins the base Stingray, Stingray Z51, and Z06 trim levels. The 2017 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray coupe comes with a roof panel that you can remove and store in the trunk. Choose the convertible and experience the car's power soft top.
The 2017 Stingray base model comes standard with a powerhouse of a V8 engine that's paired with a seven-speed manual transmission. Even though there's a lot of power (455 hp!) under the hood, you won't feel jostled. Because of the attention to comfort, you'll enjoy the snug experience of feeling like you're in the cockpit of a fighter jet.</p></th>

<th><img src="images/SportsCar8.JPG" alt="BMW X1" style="border:2px solid tomato;"><h1>BMW X1</h1><hr>
<p>What if your "typical" sports sedan or coupe doesn't meet your cargo storage or passenger space needs? If this is the case, then you might instead want to check out a small sports SUV, such as the 2017 BMW X1 . This two-row crossover can seat up to five passengers comfortably, yet it still comes with the sporty style and luxurious features that you're looking for.
Specifically, the 2017 X1 is available in two trim levels: the sDrive28i FWD and the xDrive28i AWD. Standard features on both of these trims include premium vinyl upholstery, convenient IDrive® interface, Bluetooth ® connectivity, and wipers with rain sensors. Where the X1 really shines is in its interior. Not only is it beautifully designed, but it's spacious. While the X1 may not be the first thing you think of when you think of a sports car, it is certainly a vehicle worth adding to your list of prospects—especially if you're looking for a sporty vehicle that doesn't skimp on space.</p></th>

<th><img src="images/SportsCar9.JPG" alt="Chevrolet Camaro" style="border:2px solid yellow;"><h1>Chevrolet Camaro</h1><hr>
<p>The Chevrolet Camaro was fully redesigned in 2016, and it’s steadily evolving into a sports car with the beating heart of a muscle car. The 2017 Chevrolet Camaro SS, with its 6.2L, V8 engine, can roar from zero to 60 in under four seconds.
Even though it's quick and powerful, the Camaro handles precisely and responsively. When shifting, the car is nimble and adept, making your work commute something to look forward to. The front seats are comfortable, and the interior is awash with high-quality materials.</p></th>

<th><img src="images/SportsCar10.JPG" alt="Ford Mustang" style="border:2px solid skyblue;"><h1>Ford Mustang</h1><hr>
<p>The Ford Mustang is another all-American sports car with more than 50 years of history behind it and a range of engine options for your taste and budget. The Mustang offers plenty of zip and responsive handling as both a commuter car and a weekend ride If you like your Mustangs noisy and full of adrenaline-charged fun, there’s one very special trim for you — check out our review of the Ford Mustang GT350 . This model is sure to be a future classic, and Mustang fans love it.
As a four-seater, the Mustang makes it easy for you to cart the kids around while still enjoying a sports car body style and pep. The Track Apps feature, found on trims like the
2017 Ford Mustang GT, lets you automatically measure lap times and other data, while the rearview camera available on newer model years makes backing into those tight parking spaces a breeze.</p></th>
